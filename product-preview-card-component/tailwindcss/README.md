## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS (CDN)

### What I learned

- The `<picture>` tag is useful for using different images based on media queries.
- The `rounded-[inherit]` property can be applied to the `<img>` tag.
- The height of an enclosed text element slightly varies depending on whether it is inline, inline-block, or block.
